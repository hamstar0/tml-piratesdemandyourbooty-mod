Plan v1
-	Pirate lackey appears and demands ransom or invasion happens
-	Depending on offering:
	-	If sucks or nil, invasion happens immediately
	-	If lackluster, a warning is issued, and an invasion occurs on repeat
	-	If mediocre, all loot is lost, and pirate simply disappears
	-	If good, all loot is lost, but player gets a secret orb supply dump somewhere
	-	AM only: If excellent, the pirate envoy is slain, and all of the loot and orbs appear
-	If a pirate invasion happens
	-	It happens regardless of pre-hardmode status
	-	It lasts a whole day, and then the pirates leave
	-	All surface-dwelling NPCs die, but randomly
-	AM only: When a secret orb/loot dump occurs, a note is included to mention secret support for cause
